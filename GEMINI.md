# Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered landscaping redesign tool. It allows users to upload an image of their outdoor space, select a landscaping style, and receive a redesigned image generated by the Gemini AI model. The application is built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, and it uses the Gemini API for its core AI functionality.

The application features a multi-page design, including a designer page, a history of generated designs, a pricing page, and a contact page. State is managed using React's Context API, with separate contexts for application state, user history, and toast notifications.
